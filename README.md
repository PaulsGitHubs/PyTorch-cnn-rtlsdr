This repo is an PyTorch implementation of CNN for RTL SDR signal classification.
It is inspired by Randaller's CNN-RTLSDR repo -> https://github.com/randaller/cnn-rtlsdr (which uses Tenserflow and Keras). 
I rewrote the code and added some new features to it.
The code is buggy and is constantly being improved, it will be finished soon.
